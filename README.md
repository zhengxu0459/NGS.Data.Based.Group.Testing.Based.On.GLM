This folder contains R script files to implement our methods in the manuscript 
"Next-Generation Sequencing Data-Based Association Testing of a Group of Genetic Markers for Complex Responses Using a Generalized Linear Model Framework". 

R script files implement (1) joint significance test and (2) variable collapse test 
for (1) continous, (2) binary and (3) count phenotype 

Update will be continuously made to add new codes and polish existing codes.

The six R script files are:
(1) Joint-Significance-Test-Continuous-Phenotype.R;
(2) Joint-Significance-Test-Binary-Phenotype.R;
(3) Joint-Significance-Test-Count-Phenotype.R;
(4) Variable-Collapse-Test-Continuous-Phenotype.R;
(5) Variable-Collapse-Test-Binary-Phenotype.R;
(6) Variable-Collapse-Test-Count-Phenotype.R;
